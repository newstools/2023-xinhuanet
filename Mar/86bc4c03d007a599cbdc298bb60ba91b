The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) issued an orange warning as it forecast up to 30 cm of snow and heavy winds that could be a danger to the public and bring serious damage to property. Anticipating blocked roads, the Swedish Transport Administration urged the public to work from home if possible and cautioned motorists that they should bring blankets and warm clothing as well as food and water in case of emergency. Local municipalities struggled to clear the roads. During the morning hours, around 70 bus routes had already been canceled in and around Stockholm, especially along east coast where virtually all buses were canceled, local media reported. Stockholm Arlanda Airport was also affected. According to Flightradar24, 11 flights had been canceled by 10 a.m. and several flights were delayed. As the blizzard swept in across southern Sweden from the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, the western part of the country reported severe traffic disruptions and even accidents. The blizzard is forecasted to abate on Thursday, the SMHI said. â–   A pedestrian walks amid snow in Stockholm, Sweden, March 8, 2023.
