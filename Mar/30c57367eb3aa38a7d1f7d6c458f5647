KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Fitch Solutions has on Thursday held unchanged its near-term palm oil price forecasts of annual averages of 3,800 ringgit (848 U.S. dollars) per tonne through 2023, with upside risks, and 3,400 ringgit per tonne (759 U.S. dollars) through 2024. The reports about that Indonesia is set to suspend some palm oil export licenses on a temporary basis, along with the depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit, also supported the bullish sentiment. Fitch Solutions now forecast that the global palm oil market will produce a narrow deficit in 2022-23, the first annual net negative position since 2015-16. Its view on the medium-term evolution of palm oil prices remains unchanged. The research house, however, sees prices falling to 2,200 ringgit (491 U.S. dollars) per tonne in 2027 alongside a gradual loosening of the global production balance on the back of a continued decline in European Union palm oil demand, while noting downward pressures on production growth in Indonesia and Malaysia. According to Fitch Solutions, palm oil prices have averaged 3,977 ringgit (888 U.S. dollars) per tonne through the year to date.  â–
