BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Theft and drugs are among the highest factors of recidivism in Brunei, said Haji Ahmaddin, the country's minister of home affairs, at the ongoing 19th Legislative Council meeting. According to the local daily Borneo Bulletin on Friday, the minister said that with the involvement of the community and stakeholders, several initiatives have been undertaken to help ex-prisoners remove the stigma. The minister added that former inmates undergo several programs in prison to ensure that they are fully rehabilitated when they complete their sentences and return to the community. The minister said this in response to a legislative council member's queries on a Prison Department analysis in identifying the highest types of criminal activity and the reasons for repeat offenses and re-entry into prison.  â–
