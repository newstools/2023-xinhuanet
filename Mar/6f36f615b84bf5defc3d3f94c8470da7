HOUSTON, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday reported an increase of 6.203 million barrels of crude oil in U.S. inventories for the week ending Feb. 24. Analysts expected a hike of 0.44 million barrels for this week. The API reported a surge of 9.895 million barrels in the previous week. Oil prices climbed on Tuesday as traders bet on rising demand from China. The West Texas Intermediate for April delivery gained 1.37 U.S. dollars, or 1.81 percent, to settle at 77.05 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude for April delivery added 1.44 dollars, or 1.75 percent, to close at 83.89 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange. The rally came as traders focused on rising demand from China. "The situation on the oil market will tighten noticeably as Chinese demand picks up further," Barbara Lambrecht, energy analyst at Commerzbank Research, said Tuesday in a note. Traders also assessed oil supply from Russia as the country has previously announced that it would cut production by 500,000 barrels a day in March.  â–
