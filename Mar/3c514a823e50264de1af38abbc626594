SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's export would be hard to recover without a rebound in demand for chips, the country's deputy prime minister for economic affairs said on Thursday. "Without a rebound in the semiconductor industry, there will inevitably be restrictions and difficulties in the recovery of export for the time being," Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Choo Kyung-ho told an emergency meeting with economy-related ministers. The outbound shipment declined 7.5 percent in February from a year earlier, continuing to slide for the fifth straight month. Semiconductor export tumbled 42.5 percent last month. Choo, however, noted that there were still positive signs, such as rapid growth in exports for rechargeable batteries and automobiles. Automotive export surged 47.1 percent in February on stronger demand for eco-friendly vehicles, and shipment for rechargeable batteries jumped 25.1 percent. Choo said the government will make all-out efforts to achieve this year's export goal of 685 billion U.S. dollars, vowing to beef up the competitiveness of major industries by securing next-generation technologies and fostering manpower.  â–
