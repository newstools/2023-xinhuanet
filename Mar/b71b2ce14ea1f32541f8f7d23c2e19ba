HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Residents in some southern localities in Vietnam have been advised to protect themselves as the UV Index hit "extremely high" levels recently, local media reported on Thursday. Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho city and Ca Mau province, and Nha Trang city in the south-central Khanh Hoa province saw UV Index levels rise to 10, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, the local newspaper Vietnam News reported. Level 10 means very high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Human skin can burn after just 25 minutes. Level 11 and above means a threatening volume of UV, which can damage human skin and burn eyes if outside for just 15 minutes without any protection, the newspaper said. High UV levels in southern Vietnam can be attributed to the weather condition. They appear mostly during clear skies, in the middle of the dry season and in conjunction between dry and rainy seasons in southern Vietnam. Doctors recommend people to consider not going out when the UV Index is above 7. If it reaches 10, the radiation can be extremely harmful, and people should stay inside to avoid direct exposure to sunlight.  â–
