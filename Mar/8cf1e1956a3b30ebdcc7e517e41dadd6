CHICAGO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose on Friday on turbulence in the U.S. banking sector. The most active gold contract for April delivery rose 32.60 U.S. dollars, or 1.78 percent, to close at 1,867.20 dollars per ounce. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) after its parent company, SVB Financial Group, on Thursday disclosed large losses from securities sales. Closing of SVB triggered concerns about contagion in the banking sector, supporting gold. The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that U.S. total employment increased by 311,000 in February, significantly more than the 225,000 new jobs economists were expecting. And U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6 percent in February from 3.4 percent in January, worse than expectations but holding flat at the lowest level since 1969. The U.S. dollar index and treasury yields fell following the release of the latest monthly U.S. jobs data, further supporting gold. Investors are waiting for the release of the consumer price index on Tuesday for additional hints as to how much the Federal Reserve may hike rates at its next monetary policy meeting. Gold prices rose 0.7 percent for the week. Silver for May delivery rose 34.10 cents, or 1.69 percent, to close at 20.506 dollars per ounce. Platinum for April delivery rose 12.90 dollars, or 1.36 percent, to close at 962.20 dollars per ounce.  â–
