BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 60,293 foreigners worked in Brunei with valid work permits in November 2022, said Haji Ahmaddin, the country's minister of home affairs at the ongoing 19th Legislative Council meeting. According to the local daily Borneo Bulletin on Friday, the minister said in response to a Legislative Council member's queries that 16,444 foreigners worked in the construction sector, 12,191 in wholesale, retail and vehicle maintenance sector, and 8,386 in the accommodation and catering sector. Quoting a Labour Department census last year, the minister said that most foreign workers (30,612) were between 30 and 40 years old. Meanwhile, in terms of education, 50,643 were at or below the secondary, technical and vocational levels. "Statistically speaking, there is room for local youth to fill job vacancies. The question now is whether they are willing to do so," he said. The most employed foreign workers were Indonesian, Bangladeshi and Filipino nationals, the minister added. Located in Southeast Asia, northwest of Kalimantan, Brunei had about 440,000 total population in 2021.  â–
