BAMAKO, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen civilians were killed and six others wounded in fresh attacks on two villages in central Mali Thursday and Saturday, the Bandiagara governorate said in a statement Tuesday. The first attack, which took place Thursday afternoon in the village of Kani-Bonzon, left 12 people dead and five more wounded, while the second attack, which occurred Saturday evening in the village of Tobolo, resulted in two deaths, one wounded, and "significant material damage," read the statement. According to eyewitnesses, many teachers, including a school principal were among the victims in Kani-Bonzon. They were taken by surprise and shot while playing soccer on a field at the entrance to the village. The governor of Bandiagara, Sidi Mohamed El Bechir, has strongly condemned these "ignoble and barbaric" attacks perpetrated by "lawless individuals." The Malian government has not officially reacted to these raids, but two of its members went to the scene Tuesday to show their solidarity with the terrorized population and assure them of the protection of the State. Since 2012, Mali has been plagued by insurgencies, jihadist incursions, and inter-community violence that have left thousands of people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.  â–
