CHICAGO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Tuesday as investors digested remarks of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The most active gold contract for April delivery fell 34.60 U.S. dollars, or 1.87 percent, to close at 1,820 dollars per ounce. In his testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Powell left the door open to more aggressive interest rate hikes as his priority is to restore price stability over employment. "If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes," Powell said. Powell's testimony raised the possibility for a more aggressive pace of rate hikes, which boosted the U.S. dollar and dampened gold. There are already market analysts predicting that there may be a 50-basis-point interest rate hike at the March 22 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Powell will appear before a House Financial Services panel on Wednesday. The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that U.S. wholesale inventories dropped 0.4 percent as initially estimated in January. Silver for May delivery fell 93.60 cents, or 4.43 percent, to close at 20.199 dollars per ounce. Platinum for April delivery fell 42.30 dollars, or 4.32 percent, to close at 936.30 dollars per ounce. â–
