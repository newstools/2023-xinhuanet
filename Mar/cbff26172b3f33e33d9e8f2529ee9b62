SEOUL, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Almost 60 percent of South Koreans opposed the government's push to resolve Japan's wartime forced labor issue through a foundation donated by the South Korean private sector, a poll showed Friday. According to the Gallup Korea poll of 1,002 adults conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, 59 percent of respondents said they oppose the so-called third-party reimbursement plan as it has no apology and reparations from Japan. Those in favor of the solution were 35 percent. The government announced its plan on Monday to compensate the victims, who were forced by the Imperial Japan into heavy labor without pay during World War II, through a foundation funded by voluntary donations from the South Korean private sector, rather than direct payment by Japanese companies held accountable. The survey showed 64 percent of the respondents feel no need for the country to hurriedly mend ties with Japan unless Japan changes its attitude. A majority of 85 percent said the Japanese government has not repented for its wartime atrocities, while 8 percent believed that Japan did so. The poll had plus and minus 3.1 percentage points in margin of error with a 95-percent confidence level.  â–
