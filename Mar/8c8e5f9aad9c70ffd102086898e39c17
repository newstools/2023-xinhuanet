LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people died late Saturday night after two suspected smuggling boats capsized off the coast of San Diego, California, authorities said on Sunday. It's "one of the worst maritime smuggling tragedies" in San Diego, said San Diego Lifeguard Chief James Gartland at a press briefing. Officials said that a Spanish-speaking woman called 911 around 11:30 p.m. local time Saturday night (0630 GMT Sunday), saying two boats, carrying eight and 15 people, respectively, had overturned near Black's Beach in San Diego. Eight bodies had already been discovered. Authorities would comb the area for other victims Sunday after thick fog lifted. Coast Guard Capt. James Spitler, a sector commander for the San Diego Coast Guard, said that there's been a 771-percent increase in human trafficking in the Southern California coastal region since 2017.  â–
