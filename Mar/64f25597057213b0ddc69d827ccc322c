BARCELONA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- In the past five decades, the China-Spain relations are stable, mutually beneficial and with the potential to become stronger in the future, Joaquin Beltran, professor of East Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, has said. Speaking to Xinhua on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Spain, which fell on Thursday, the professor underlined economic, cultural, educational exchanges between the two countries that "enrich us mutually," saying they should continue and deepen these relations. The professor highlighted the economic links between China and Spain, recalling in 1973, when the diplomatic relations were established, there was barely any trade between the two countries. But that has been changed radically in recent decades, with China becoming Spain's major trading partner, Beltran said. Many Chinese entrepreneurs started their businesses in Spain, contributing to the Spanish economy, said Beltran. The past 50 years witnessed not just growing economic ties but personnel exchanges, as can be seen by the tremendous growth of the Chinese expat community in towns and cities all over Spain. "In China, a Cervantes Institute has opened, which is for spreading Spanish language and culture. And here in Spain, Confucius Institutes have opened to do the same job," said Beltran. "Music and circus groups or museum exhibitions come to Spain from China. Spain also sends performing artists and painters (to China), and there has been an increase in these types of cultural relations," he added. The professor also pointed out the increasing presence of Chinese students at Spanish universities, with the number returning to pre-pandemic levels. The professor concluded that the two countries should enhance mutual understanding, saying there is still a lot of work to do.  â–
