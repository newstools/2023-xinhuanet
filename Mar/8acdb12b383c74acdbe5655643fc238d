BERLIN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Eintracht Frankfurt stay in the Bundesliga's top six despite sharing the spoils with Wolfsburg following a two-all draw at the closing of the 23rd round on Sunday. The "Wolves" started perfectly in front of the home crowd and opened the scoring with Omar Marmoush on just ten minutes. Wolfsburg's advantage didn't last long, though, after the Eagles leveled the score in the 22nd minute when Aurelio Buta whipped a cross to the back and met Randal Kolo Muani's head. The visitors increased the pressure and turned the tide four minutes later after Evan Ndicka drilled a loose ball into the top left corner. Wolfsburg eventually restored parity just before the halftime when Patrick Wimmer's pinpoint cross to the near post found Gerhardt, who nodded home into the far post corner. After the restart, goalscoring chances were at a premium as both teams seemed content with the share of the points. The Wolves dominated possession but didn't pose a lot of danger in Frankfurt's territory. "It was an entertaining first half with chances at both ends. We are happy with the point even though it doesn't really help in the table," said Wolfsburg captain Maximilian Arnold. "Wolfsburg defended well. It was important for us not to lose here. We keep Wolfsburg on the distance in the standings. A victory would have been great, and we had our chances, but it's not easy to win here," said Frankfurt skipper Sebastian Rode. Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin remain in touching distance to the Bundesliga drop zone after Bayer Leverkusen secured a 4-1 victory on home soil.  â–
