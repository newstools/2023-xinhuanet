SHIBERGHAN, Afghanistan, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Police have discovered a weapon cache from Shiberghan city, the capital of Afghanistan's northern Jawzjan province, provincial police spokesman Abdul Satar Halimi said Monday. "Acting on a tip-off, the police launched operations in Police District 1 of Shiberghan city on Sunday and discovered a weapon cache containing a variety of arms and ammunitions including gun shells, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines," the official told reporters. The official didn't say if anyone was arrested. Police personnel would continue to collect arms and ammunition from anyone outside security organizations to stabilize peace and security in the province, the official said. In similar operations a couple of weeks ago, police also collected a huge quantity of arms and ammunition including six pieces of U.S.-made M16 rifles, four Kalashnikovs, and thousands of rounds of bullets from some individuals in the neighboring Balkh province.  â–
