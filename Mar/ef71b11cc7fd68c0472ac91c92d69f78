NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a high-level government meeting to review preparedness for hot weather in the upcoming summer. According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Modi was briefed during the meeting on the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) weather forecast for the next few months and on the likelihood of a normal monsoon, the expected yield of major crops, preparedness of medical infrastructure and preparations for disaster-related to heat and mitigation measures. Last week the IMD warned of a hotter-than-usual March, April and May across most parts of the South Asian country. Experts said the enhanced probability of the occurrence of a heatwave during March to May season is likely to hit farm production and hike food prices in the South Asian country. Last year, India experienced its hottest March in over a hundred years, which damaged the country's grain harvest and forced the government to curb wheat exports. Modi called for preparing awareness material for stakeholders including the public, medical professionals, civic authorities and disaster response teams like firefighters. He also directed officials to incorporate some multimedia lecture sessions in schools to educate children on dealing with extreme heat conditions. "Prime Minister stressed on the need for detailed fire audits of all hospitals and that mock fire drills be done in all hospitals by firefighters," PMO said. February in India saw record heat since 1901, with the average maximum temperature recorded at 29.66 degrees Celsius.  â–
