GABORONE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- As much as Botswana remains committed to the international agreements on reducing emissions toward attaining a green economy, the shift from fossils has to be a nondiscriminatory transition, a Botswanan official said Friday. Lefoko Moagi, Botswana's Minister of Minerals and Energy, told an energy consultative workshop in Francistown, the second largest city of Botswana, that no one should be marginalized. "Transitioning from coal should take into consideration those currently dependent on the resource and how best to serve them," said Moagi. Botswana generates an estimated 789MW of electricity daily at its Morupule Power Station, situated in the central part of the southern African country, primarily from coal mainly because of its abundance of about 212 billion tons and cost-effectiveness, according to recent figures from Statistics Botswana. Renewable energy projects producing 135MW are under construction with a 200MW concentrated solar power plant project currently at the procurement stage, he said.  â–
