DAKAR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Senegal paid tribute to three of its soldiers killed last week in Mali under a United Nations operation. "The nation will be eternally grateful to them," said Senegalese Minister of Armed Forces Sidiki Kaba, during a ceremony held on Wednesday at Camp Dial Diop, the Senegalese Army headquarters in Dakar. According to Kaba, the Senegalese state has already taken measures to support the families in mourning their loved ones, in addition to support provided by the United Nations. The three soldiers were killed on Feb. 21 in central Mali when their convoy hit an improvised explosive device. They were part of the 11th Senegalese detachment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. The detachment has been operating in Mali since September.  â–
