COLOMBO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan rupee appreciated for one week against the U.S. dollar, Central Bank data showed on Tuesday. Issuing a statement, the Central Bank said the rupee was buying at 318.30 and selling at 335.75 against the U.S. dollar. The data showed the rupee has also appreciated against the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Canadian dollar, and Japanese yen. The Sri Lankan rupee opened stronger to the U.S. dollar on March 1, which marked a 10-month high against the U.S. dollar. Sri Lanka's financial press has speculated that the rupee strengthened after the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) relaxed a surrender rule, reducing central bank purchases. Sri Lankan rupees collapsed from 202 per dollar in March 2022 to around 360 after the government allowed the rupee to float.  â–
