LEIDEN, the Netherlands, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Two plants of the Amorphophallus gigas, a species in the rare Amorphophallus known as the "corpse flower," were in bloom on Saturday in the Leiden Botanical Garden in the Netherlands. The largest of the two Amorphophallus gigas plants stood at over three meters tall. The blooming plants, which gave off a terrible smell of decay, attracted a flock of visitors to the oldest garden in the Netherlands. It was already the third time for the rare "corpse flower" to bloom in the garden in less than one year. In July last year, a plant of the Amorphophallus titanum blossomed while another species of the "corpse flower," Amorphophallus decus-silvae, was in bloom last October.  â–
