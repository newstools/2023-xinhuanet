BANGKOK, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining self-precaution and non-discriminatory preventative measures is the key to Thailand's economic recovery, said Prasit Watanapa, a senior medical expert and advisor to the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital. From Jan. 15 to Jan. 21, the number of COVID-19-related hospital admissions and deaths dropped by 32 percent from a week earlier, to a daily average of 90 and six, respectively, according to the data released by the health ministry. Thailand needs to adjust its public health measures according to the current situation while maintaining economic, health and social balance, as it continues apace towards recovery, Prasit said in an interview with Xinhua. He noted that Thailand has now found COVID-19 infections from most of the variants that are spreading around the world and there is a risk of introducing new infections into the country due to an influx of foreign visitors. However, being fully vaccinated is still the most effective way of self-protection against the virus, Prasit stressed. "Instead of being overly concerned about others, it is better to start protecting ourselves," he said, adding, "It is the government's duty to minimize the risks from foreign arrivals, but that does not mean applying different entry rules that lead to discrimination." Currently, the most common COVID-19 variant in Thailand is the Omicron sub-lineage, BA.2.75, representing 86 percent of all cases, according to the country's health authorities. Even if the effectiveness against infections decreases, the COVID-19 vaccines are still significantly effective in preventing severe disease, Prasit said.  â–
