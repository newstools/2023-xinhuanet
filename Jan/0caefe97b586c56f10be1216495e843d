TRIPOLI, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Health Minister Ramadan Abu-Janah on Sunday discussed with the Indonesian charge d'affaires to Libya healthcare cooperation between the two countries. The meeting discussed providing necessary healthcare for migrants in Libya and recruiting Indonesian medical personnel in hospitals in remote areas, the government said in a statement following the meeting. Didi Rifai, the Indonesian charge d'affaires, expressed his country's aspiration to strengthen cooperation with Libya in exporting medicines through international companies, the statement said. Indonesia was the G20 president in 2022, according to the statement. Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Libyan Authority for Investment Promotion and Privatization Jamal Allamushi said Libya seeks to enhance cooperation with Indonesia in nearly 20 projects, and that this matter can be discussed through a joint technical team between the two countries, the statement added. Because of the state of insecurity and chaos in Libya since the fall of the late leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011, Libyan authorities have been struggling to provide proper basic services for people.  â–
