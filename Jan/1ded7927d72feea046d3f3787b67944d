CHICAGO, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose on Friday as the U.S. dollar weakened. The most active gold contract for February delivery rose 29.1 U.S. dollars, or 1.58 percent, to close at 1,869.7 dollars per ounce. Gold posted a gain of 2.4 percent for the week. The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, the smallest increase in two years but better than an increase of 200,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent, while hourly pay rose by 0.3 percent. Market analysts hold that the employment data were upbeat, but not strong enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to be even more aggressive on its tightening monetary policy. Economic data released Friday also supported gold. The Institute for Supply Management's services index registered at 49.6 percent, a 6.9-percentage point decrease from the November reading of 56.5 percent. The U.S. Commerce Department reported U.S. factory orders dropped 1.8 percent in November after gaining 0.4 percent in October. The drop is larger than economists' forecast of falling 0.8 percent. Addressing a panel sponsored by the National Association of Business Economics in New Orleans on Friday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the Federal Reserve needs to raise its benchmark rate above 5 percent this year, but should not need to increase it much further. Silver for March delivery rose 55.8 cents, or 2.38 percent, to close at 23.982 dollars per ounce. Platinum for April delivery rose 34.7 dollars, or 3.24 percent, to close at 1,104.3 dollars per ounce.  â–
