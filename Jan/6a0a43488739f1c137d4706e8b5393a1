KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), eased to 3.8 percent in December last year from 4 percent in November 2022, official data showed on Friday. The slower increase in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group of 6.8 percent as compared to 7.3 percent in the previous month has contributed to the lower growth in national inflation, the Department of Statistics, Malaysia (DOSM) said in a statement. According to the DOSM, transport (4.9 percent) and furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance (3.7 percent) also recorded a slower increase as compared to November 2022. However, restaurants and hotels continued to show an increase of 7.4 percent as against 7 percent in November last year. Core inflation, which measures changes in the prices of all goods and services without taking into account the volatile prices of fresh food as well as administered prices of goods by the government, registered an increase of 4.1 percent year-on-year in December 2022. The highest increase was recorded in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group with 8.1 percent. Meanwhile, inflation for the overall year 2022 rose 3.3 percent as compared to 2.5 percent in 2021. The increase was mainly attributed to food and non alcoholic beverages (5.8 percent), restaurants and hotels (5 percent) and transport (4.7 percent). The DOSM said the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the global food price increases in 2022 were attributed to the increase in the inflation for the year. As for the fourth quarter of 2022, the inflation climbed 3.9 percent from the same quarter of the preceding year.  â–
