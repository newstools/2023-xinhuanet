LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite a limited theatrical release in the United States and Canada, China's homemade sci-fi blockbuster "The Wandering Earth II" broke into the Top 10 at the North American box office this weekend, according to studio figures released by measurement firm Comscore on Sunday. The much-anticipated prequel to China's sci-fi epic, "The Wandering Earth," is being released by Well Go USA in Mandarin with English and Chinese subtitles in some major cities across the United States and Canada. Comscore senior movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian pointed out in an email to Xinhua that the film "had a terrific weekend rounding out the Top 10 with 1.355 million dollars in just 170 locations." "The Wandering Earth II" has earned 2.71 million dollars in North America since it was released on Jan. 22, the Chinese Lunar New Year's Day. Dergarabedian added that the film "had another strong showing" with 144.325 million dollars for the weekend at global box office for a worldwide cume to date of 465.95 million dollars "riding a wave of Lunar New Year momentum." "The Wandering Earth," released in 2019, is the fifth highest-grossing non-English film in the world of all time, earning nearly 700 million dollars worldwide, including nearly 6 million dollars in North America. Directed by Guo Fan and starring Andy Lau, Wu Jing and Li Xuejian, "The Wandering Earth II" tells the story of mankind building enormous engines to propel Earth to a new solar system as the sun is rapidly burning out. This week, James Cameron's science fiction film "Avatar: The Way of Water" remained victorious at the North American box office for the seventh consecutive weekend with an estimated three-day cume of 15.7 million U.S. dollars. â–
