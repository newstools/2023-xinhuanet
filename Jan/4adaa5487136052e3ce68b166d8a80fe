LJUBLJANA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 artworks by Slovenian children on the theme of China are on display at an exhibition that opened at Ljubljana City Hall Tuesday. The event, to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Slovenia, and the Chinese New Year, is themed "United in Creativity." Pupils at Trnovo Elementary School, where the Ljubljana Confucius Classroom is located, participated in the art exhibition. The children drew Chinese myths and legends, festival customs and food, and the event organizers selected the 10 best works. Chinese Ambassador to Slovenia Wang Shunqing presented awards to the winners. "The children used their brushes to outline the friendship at present and in the future between China and Slovenia," Wang said, noting that the Confucius Institute of Ljubljana and the Confucius Classrooms in Slovenia provide a good platform for cultural exchanges between the two countries. Deputy Mayor of Ljubljana Deja Crnek encouraged the pupils to study hard and become Slovenian Ambassadors to China one day. One of the art competition winners, Karolina Gawish Jankovic, recalled her task of drawing Pangu, a giant in Chinese mythology who created the Earth by separating heaven and earth and became geographic features such as mountains and rivers. Each child took one ticket from their teacher with numbers corresponding to a part of the story of Pangu and drew that story. "I got Pangu in the egg," Karolina said, referring to the part of the story where Pangu emerges from a cosmic egg to create the world. The exhibition is open to the public until Feb. 12.  â–
