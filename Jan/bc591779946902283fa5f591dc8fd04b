LAGOS, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian troops have killed four bandits and recovered arms and ammunition in two operations in the northern state of Kaduna, the military said on Tuesday. Troops based in Kaduna responded on Monday to calls of distress about a bandit attack on a village in the Giwa local government area of the state, Musa Danmadami, a military spokesman, said in a statement. The troops engaged the bandits in a gunfight and killed two of them, recovering one AK-47 rifle, said Danmadami, adding that the troops also carried out an ambush operation on Tuesday near another village in the same local government, killing two bandits and recovering two AK-47 rifles. The spokesman said the troops were sustaining the fight against violent crimes in the state and urged local people to "provide credible and timely information on criminal activities." Banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities have been afflicting parts of the most populous African country recently. The military said it is in control of the situation with multiple ongoing operations against armed groups.  â–
