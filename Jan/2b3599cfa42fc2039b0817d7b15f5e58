NEW YORK, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's major averages rallied on Friday as investors reacted positively to the December U.S. jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 700.53 points, or 2.13 percent, to 33,630.61. The S&P 500 added 86.98 points, or 2.28 percent, to 3,895.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 264.05 points, or 2.56 percent, to 10,569.29. All the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with materials and technology up 3.44 percent and 2.99 percent, respectively, leading the advance. The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December, slightly higher than the market estimate of 200,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, hourly pay rose by 0.3 percent, slightly less than expected and down from 0.4 percent a month earlier. Investors were partly relieved as the slower pace of wage increases offered positive signs on the inflation front, experts noted. The Institute for Supply Management said that the U.S. services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) fell to 49.6 percent in December from 56.5 percent in the prior month. Numbers under 50 percent indicate contraction in the sector.  â–
