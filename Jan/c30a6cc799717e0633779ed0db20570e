ABUJA, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were killed and eight others injured early Friday in a road accident in Nigeria's southwestern state of Ogun, the traffic police said. Babatunde Akinbiyi, spokesperson of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, told reporters in Abeokuta, the state capital, that the incident occurred in the Ewekoro local government area where a car at high speed rammed into another from the rear, causing casualties. "The accident was mainly due to excessive speed and loss of control," Akinbiyi said, adding that the deceased died on the spot. All the injured have been conveyed to a local hospital for treatment, he said. Deadly road accidents are frequently reported in Nigeria, often caused by overloading, bad road conditions, and reckless driving.  â–
