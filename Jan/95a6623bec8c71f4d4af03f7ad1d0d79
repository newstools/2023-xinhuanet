SYDNEY, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Australia's New South Wales (NSW) has announced 40 million Australian dollars (about 28 million U.S. dollars) in funding for innovative researchers, startups and entrepreneurs in the biological sciences space. The state government said on Wednesday that the funding would bring benefits to the industry over the next four years. It will support projects across the branches of the biological sciences including relatively new fields such as biomanufacturing, genetic engineering, synthetic biology and agrifoods.
