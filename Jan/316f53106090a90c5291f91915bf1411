LAGOS, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian railway authorities on Sunday announced the closure of a train station in the southern state of Edo until further notice after an armed attack Saturday. The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said in a statement the decision became necessary following rising security challenges. "This is to inform our general public, and most especially our esteemed passengers, that the station has been temporarily closed due to security issues, till further notice," the NRC said. Nigerian police told Xinhua on the phone Sunday a group of gunmen gained entry into the Igueben train station in Edo state Saturday and began to shoot sporadically in the air before abducting scores of passengers waiting to be conveyed to Warri, a city in the neighboring Delta state. The police have launched an operation to arrest the fleeing gunmen and rescue the abducted victims, said a police spokesperson.  â–
