DHAKA, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- The 27th edition of the Dhaka International Trade Fair (DITF), the largest annual commercial and trade event in Bangladesh, kicked off Sunday at the mega Chinese-built venue the Bangabandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center (BBCFEC). The trade fair, which is being held at the BBCFEC located in Purbachal on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, will last for a month. The construction of the BBCFEC, by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) with Chinese funds, was completed in 2021 despite impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the South Asian country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the trade fair. This year's DITF features more than 350 local and foreign stalls, pavilions and mini pavilions, compared to the previous year's tally of 225.
