KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's leading index, a predictive tool used to anticipate economic upturns and downturns in an average of four to six months ahead, remains moderate by recording 110.5 points in November last year, official data showed on Friday. The decrease was due to real money supply, M1, Bursa Malaysia Industrial Index, number of housing units approved, expected sales value, manufacturing and number of new companies registered, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) said in a statement. On the other hand, the leading index's monthly performance recorded an increase of 0.8 percent in November 2022 compared to a negative 0.3 percent in the previous month. This trend was driven by the expected sales value, manufacturing at 0.3 percent, real imports of other basic precious and other non-ferrous metals at 0.3 percent, number of new companies registered at 0.2 percent, real imports of semiconductors at 0.1 percent and real money supply, M1 at 0.05 percent. "Looking at the smoothed long-term trend in November 2022, leading index remains trending below the trend of 100 points. Accordingly, the Malaysian economy is expected to moderate in the months ahead in 2023, despite the risk of a global economic slowdown," the DOSM said. As for the current economic position, the coincident index recorded an increase of 5.5 percent year-on-year to 120.6 points in November 2022, as compared to 114.3 points in November 2021. The monthly change of the coincident index also registered a slight growth of 0.1 percent supported by the industrial production index, real salaries and wages, manufacturing, total employment, manufacturing and real contributions, and Employees Provident Fund (EPF).  â–
