BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- A 40-year-old foreign man was detained by the Brunei authorities for allegedly smuggling 12,160 cartons, 269 packets and 80 sticks of cigarettes, local media reported on Sunday. According to the local daily Borneo Bulletin, it was the largest seizure of contraband involving cigarettes, with a tax value worth more than 1.1 million Brunei dollars (0.83 million U.S. dollars). All the items, including cash amounting to 2,331 Brunei dollars (1,768 U.S. dollars) believed to be proceeds from the contraband sale, were seized and the suspect was arrested for further investigation. Brunei's Royal Customs and Excise Department advised the public to always adhere to the laws and avoid smuggling activities. Brunei ratified the World Health Organization Framework Convention for Tobacco Control in 2004, which was designed to reduce the devastating health and economic impact of cigarette smoking. According to Brunei laws, tobacco-producing and selling are strictly forbidden in the sultanate and heavy duties are imposed on imported cigarettes and those who are convicted of tobacco smuggling will face huge fines or imprisonment. In February 2020, a 24-year-old local man was sentenced to pay a 298,000 Brunei dollars (226,000 U.S. dollars) fine or serve 27 months imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to possessing 152 cartons and eight packs of smuggled cigarettes.  â–
