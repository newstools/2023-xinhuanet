CAIRO, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Saturday expressed its "total rejection and strong condemnation" of the shooting attack in East Jerusalem that left seven people dead a day earlier. "Egypt warned of the severe risks of the ongoing escalation between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, calling for the exercise of the utmost restraint," said the Egyptian Foreign Ministry in a statement. Egypt stressed its condemnation of "all operations targeting civilians," it added. It urged the Israelis and Palestinians to avoid falling into "a vicious circle of violence" that worsens the political and humanitarian situations and undermines all chances of reviving the peace process. Seven people were killed in a shooting attack in a settlement in East Jerusalem on Friday night. The attack came a day after a deadly Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank killed at least nine Palestinians and injured several others. â–
