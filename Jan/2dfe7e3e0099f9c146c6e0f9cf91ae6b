ABUJA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Six people have been rescued out of 31 taken hostage by a group of unknown gunmen who attacked a train station in Nigeria's southern state of Edo at the weekend, a government spokesperson said on Monday. The rescue followed an operation by security operatives combing bushes on Monday, Chris Osa Nehikhare, the commissioner for communication and orientation, said in a statement. "We are confident that the other victims will be rescued soon as the highly motivated security personnel are in high spirits and have doubled down on the hot chase of the kidnappers," Nehikhare said. He added that rescue teams had been combing bushes in the state and working tirelessly since the incident occurred to ensure the kidnapped passengers are rescued. Thirty-two people were taken hostage when the gunmen broke into the Igueben train station in Edo on Saturday evening and fired shots sporadically in the air. One of the hostages managed to escape.  â–
