CANBERRA, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- A documentarian and body image activist has been named the Australian of the Year for 2023. Taryn Brumfitt was awarded the prestigious honor by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at a ceremony on Wednesday night. The 45-year-old mother of four from South Australia (SA) was chosen from a field of eight finalists -- one from each state and territory -- for her work as a leader in the body image movement. Brumfitt's documentaries, books and speeches on learning to love her body and why people are unsatisfied with their appearance are estimated to have reached more than 200 million people worldwide. On Wednesday night Brumfitt said she would use her new platform to help change the way people view themselves. "This is not about encouraging obesity, this is not what I do, and this issue is not simply about weight or size, it's about the way that we feel about all of ourselves," she said while accepting the award. "We weren't born into the world hating our bodies. This is something the world has taught us." Brumfitt succeeds Dylan Alcott, a disability advocate and former wheelchair tennis player, as the Australian of the Year. Prime Minister Albanese said it was the ideal time for Brumfitt to be honored. "Taryn will make an enormous difference, just as Dylan Alcott has been an extraordinary Australian of the Year over the last 12 months," he said. Socceroo and refugee advocate Awer Mabil was named the Young Australian of the Year at the same ceremony on Wednesday night. Mabil grew up in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to Australia and becoming one of the country's top footballers now playing in Europe for Sparta Prague. Tom Calma, an Indigenous campaigner, was named the Senior Australian of the Year.  â–
