TUNIS, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia foiled four illegal migration attempts to cross the Mediterranean toward the Italian coast on Tuesday, National Guard Spokesman Houcemeddine Jbabli said on Wednesday. A total of 150 illegal African immigrants were arrested late Tuesday night by the coast guards on Sfax and Kerkennah coasts in southeastern Tunisia, Jbabli said in a statement. Located at the northern tip of Africa, Tunisia is one of the most popular transit points for illegal immigrants bound for Europe. Although Tunisian authorities have adopted rigorous measures to tackle the problem, the number of illegal immigrants who depart Tunisia for Italy has not decreased.  â–
