PARIS, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The consumer price index (CPI) in France rose to 6 percent year-on-year in January from 5.9 percent in December 2022, the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) said in a preliminary report on Tuesday. "This slight increase in inflation should result from an acceleration in food and energy prices," the INSEE said. Food and energy prices rose by 13.2 percent and 16.3 percent year-on-year in January, respectively. As the French government ended the 10 euro cents per liter discount and the gas price shield, the average pump price would likely soon be above 2 euros per liter. The INSEE added that the prices of manufactured goods should increase at the same rate than in the previous month, at 4.6 percent, while the increase in prices of services should slow down over one year. â–
