TUNIS, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Tunisians on Sunday started voting in the second round of legislative elections, the Tunisian Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) said. A total of 4,222 voting centers and 10,012 polling stations opened to voters at 8 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) amid tight security measures, and the voting is scheduled to continue until 6 p.m. local time (1700 GMT). "The total number of candidates running for this round reached 262, including 34 women," said the ISIE President Farouk Bouasker at a press conference held in Tunis late Saturday night. The announcement of the preliminary results of the second round of the elections will be no later than Feb. 1, and the final results, after the end of the appeals, will be announced before March 4, according to Bouasker. The first round of Tunisia's legislative elections, which took place on Dec. 17, saw a low turnout rate of 11.22 percent, with only 23 candidates confirmed seats in the new parliament. Tunisian President Kais Saied announced on March 30 last year the dissolution of the Assembly of People's Representatives, or the Tunisian parliament.  â–
