OTTAWA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced Monday it has finalized an agreement with the United States and Lockheed Martin with Pratt & Whitney to buy a fleet of 88 F-35 fighter jets. The first deliveries of the aircraft are anticipated to begin in 2026 and a fully operational fleet is expected between 2032 and 2034, according to a news release issued by Public Services and Procurement Canada. Estimated at 19 billion Canadian dollars (15.2 billion U.S. dollars), this is the largest investment for the Royal Canadian Air Force in the past 30 years, which includes associated equipment, sustainment set-up and services, as well as the construction of fighter squadron facilities, the release said. The acquisition will occur as a staggered process and acquisition plans for a number of aircraft are already confirmed with this process continuing until the full fleet of 88 jets is acquired, according to the release.  â–
