BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- QueUp, a widely-used mobile application for making public service appointments, will be made offline following a data breach incident, local media reported on Friday. Rhymin & Partners, the developer of QueUp, made the offline announcement, saying they "have taken the first line of action and currently working closely with Cyber Security Brunei to mitigate and address the impacts of this incident." "We will inform the public as soon as we restore the system," the developer said. The QueUp application is widely used to reserve appointment slots for local identity card applications, all kinds of visa applications and employment pass applications of foreign workers. In a separate statement, Brunei's Ministry of Health said that several services under the ministry are affected. QueUp is used for booking appointments for foreign workers' employment health screening and for the public to reserve vaccination slots before traveling overseas, the ministry said. The Postal Services Department said in a statement that the appointment for medicine delivery can be made by contacting nearby post offices.  â–
