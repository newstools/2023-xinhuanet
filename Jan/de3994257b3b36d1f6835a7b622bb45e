DHAKA, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has been declared free from dangerous Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane pesticide, commonly known as DDT pesticide. Bangladeshi Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin made the announcement at a press conference on Sunday. The press briefing came after Bangladesh's successful removal of 500 tons of DDT from a medical sub-depot in Chattogram city, some 242 km southeast of the capital Dhaka,  in December last year. According to the World Health Organization, DDT is a persistent organic pollutant (POP), a chemical that can have significant negative effects on both human health and the environment. Bangladesh imported 500 metric tons (500,000 kg) of the pesticide in 1985 to control malaria-carrying mosquitos. Upon arrival, it was put into a government compound in the Agrabad district in Chattogram city. Over the years, many of the boxes and bags have disintegrated, leaving exposed piles of the white DDT powder. In 1991, Bangladesh imposed a DDT ban, but the huge consignment remained. Under a project titled "Pesticide Risk Reduction in Bangladesh," the toxic substance was completely exported to France for incineration, according to the ministry.  â–
