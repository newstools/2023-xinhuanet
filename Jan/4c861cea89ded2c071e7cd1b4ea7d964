ZAGREB, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The wave of price increases in stores across Croatia following the country's adoption of the euro as its currency on Jan. 1 was "completely unjustified," Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said at a cabinet meeting on Thursday. "Prices should be restored to the level they were at before Jan. 1, kuna (Croatia's previous currency) prices should simply be converted to euro prices in a fair manner," he said earlier. "The state will take action against anyone who unjustifiably raises prices," Plenkovic said, promising "a strong government intervention" against those who did so in the process of euro conversion. The State Inspectorate and the tax and customs authorities had been instructed to act as soon as they see irregularities, he added. Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development Davor Filipovic said on Thursday that his ministry would increase its price monitoring and controlling activities and would prepare and launch a digital platform for monitoring prices. Since the introduction of the euro, the authorities in Croatia have received numerous complaints from citizens about higher prices as a result of price rounding.  â–
