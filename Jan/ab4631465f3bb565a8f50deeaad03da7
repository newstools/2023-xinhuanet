BERLIN, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany's retail sector saw turnover rise to a new record high in 2022 due to surging consumer prices, according to preliminary figures published by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) on Friday. The sector's nominal (not price-adjusted) turnover exceeded the previous year's figure by 8.2 percent. The real (price-adjusted) retail turnover was 0.3 percent lower in 2022 than in the record year of 2021. Online and mail order sales, which still recorded "enormous growth during the COVID-19 pandemic," fell 8.1 percent in real terms. Physical shops, on the other hand, roughly achieved 2021 levels as price-adjusted sales dropped by 0.3 percent only, Destatis said. According to the German Retail Association (HDE), the price-adjusted loss in turnover was much higher towards the end of last year with a decline of 5.5 percent in November. "High energy prices and inflation are causing consumer sentiment to be rather weak," a spokesperson from the HDE told Xinhua on Friday. "In the wake of great uncertainty, many consumers prefer to save their money, for example for the upcoming utility bill," the spokesperson said, adding that the conditions would remain "often difficult" in 2023.  â–
