SEOUL, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of fake South Korean banknotes hit a record low last year due to the growth in non-cash payments, central bank data showed Monday. The number of counterfeit banknotes, found by the central bank or reported by financial institutions and individuals, was 150 in 2022, down from 176 in the previous year, according to the Bank of Korea. It marked the lowest since relevant data began to be compiled in 1998. The number continued to break record lows for the fifth consecutive year as non-cash payments increased on solid demand for online transactions, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the fabricated banknotes, 5,000 won (four U.S. dollars) bills accounted for 50 percent of the total with 75, followed by 10,000 won (eight dollars) bills with 43, and 50,000 won (40 dollars) notes with 23, respectively.  â–
