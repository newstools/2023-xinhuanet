LIBREVILLE, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Gabon looks forward to more Chinese investments to revitalize its economy and boost bilateral trade, said Gabonese Minister for the Promotion of Investments Hugues Mbadinga Madiya. "Chinese investments are effective and appreciated by the Gabonese people," Madiya told Xinhua here recently in an exclusive interview. Investments from China, Gabon's largest trade partner, have contributed greatly to the central African country's socio-economic development, he said. Calling China a "friendly country," Madiya said people walking around the city of Libreville will see many infrastructures financed by Chinese investors. Apart from traditional sectors like wood and energy, where Chinese investors are well established, they are also embarking on the construction of special economic zones and industrial parks, which is favorable to tapping the great potential of Gabon, he said. Madiya said he is "completely confident" with the Chinese economy. "We have no doubt that the Chinese economy will be able to recover, because the fundamentals are there thanks to its policies to fight against COVID-19," he said. From Sunday, China started managing COVID-19 with measures designed for combating Class B infectious diseases, instead of Class A infectious diseases, while lifting COVID restrictions on international arrivals. As the country optimizes its COVID response policies, business delegations from China are heading for global destinations to boost trade and investment in overseas markets. These decisions "are good news, because we will be able to relaunch investments and move towards a recovery of the world economy," Madiya said. The Gabonese minister warmly welcomed all interested Chinese investors and entrepreneurs to visit Gabon. "Virtual communications have their limits. The construction of the economy is all about building relationships between people, between governments and between investors," he added.  â–
