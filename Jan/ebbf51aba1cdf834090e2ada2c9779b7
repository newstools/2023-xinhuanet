LJUBLJANA, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Producer prices in Slovenia increased by 19.3 percent in 2022, the highest annual growth in over 20 years, the country's statistical office said on Friday. "Compared to a year ago, prices increased in nearly all activities," the office said, adding that producer prices rose by 10.6 percent in 2021. Prices of products for sale on the domestic market were up 23.3 percent, while prices of products sold abroad increased by 15.3 percent, the office said. Energy prices increased the most, with electricity prices up as much as 101 percent over the past year. Prices of petroleum products increased by about 44 percent. The increase in producer prices is reflected in Slovenia's consumer price inflation, which reached 10.3 percent year-on-year in December 2022, up from 5.1 percent in December 2021, the statistical office reported last month. High inflation prompted wage increase demands by the country's public sector trade unions, especially after the government in January agreed to increase the wages of doctors and judges.  â–
