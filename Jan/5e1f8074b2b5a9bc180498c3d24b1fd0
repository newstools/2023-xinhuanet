DAMASCUS, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian foreign ministry on Thursday accused the United States of funding smearing campaigns against the Syrian state. In a statement, the ministry said the United States is spending millions of dollars on suspicious media outlets, aiming at distorting the image of the Syrian state. "Such policies reflect the insistence on continuing to mislead local, regional and international public opinion, and exposes the continuation of the U.S. attack targeting Syria's sovereignty and interference in its internal affairs," the ministry said. It noted that funding media campaigns against the Syrian state aims to cover the crimes of the United States in Syria and its theft of Syrian treasures and natural resources.  â–
