Anwar, who is making a two-day visit to the neighboring country, also had an audience with Brunei's Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah followed by a four-eyed meeting in the sultan's official residence. "When two country leaders have a very strong friendship ... and have plans for both countries ... they can always check the progress, and the implementation will be expedited," he said after the meeting, according to Malaysian national news agency Bernama. Anwar and the sultan also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Brunei Investment Agency.
