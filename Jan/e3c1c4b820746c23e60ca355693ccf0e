CHICAGO, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Tuesday as the U.S. dollar rose. The most active gold contract for February delivery fell 11.8 U.S. dollars, or 0.61 percent, to close at 1,909.9 dollars per ounce. Investors are carefully monitoring demand for gold as the Chinese Lunar New Year approaches, which often coincides with increased physical demand. Market analysts believe investors are also monitoring the World Economic Forum for news. The New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index released on Tuesday fell steeply to negative 32.9 in January. This is the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic in May 2020 and among the lowest levels in the survey's history, supporting gold somewhat. Silver for March delivery fell 30.4 cents, or 1.25 percent, to close at 24.068 dollars per ounce. Platinum for April delivery fell 25.6 dollars, or 2.39 percent, to close at 1,046.9 dollars per ounce.  â–
