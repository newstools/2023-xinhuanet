MOGADISHU, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Somali National Army (SNA) on Monday killed 23 al-Shabab militants and injured others in an operation conducted in southern Somalia, a senior military chief confirmed. The Chief of Defense Forces Odowaa Yusuf Rage told Somali News Agency that the forces also recovered weapons during the operation at the Danow location, a key route linking to main towns in the region and other regions. "Our forces also recovered a cache of weapons during the operation early in the morning," Rage said. He said that SNA backed by the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) forces are jointly carrying out operations aimed at flushing out militants in the Lower Shabelle region. Al-Shabab militants did not comment on the latest operation in the southern region. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has declared an all-out war against al-Shabab which is affiliated with al-Qaida terrorist network since he was sworn into office in May 2022.  â–
