KIEV, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is tightening up the defense of its border with Belarus, said Serhiy Nayev, the commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on Thursday. "We professionally perform the tasks assigned to us, and gradually increase our defense capabilities," Nayev was quoted as saying by the Joint Forces' press service. At the same time, he stressed that the current situation at the border with Belarus does not pose a direct threat of a ground offensive against Ukraine. Ukraine is in contact with its foreign partners, such as the United States and Poland, over the situation at the Ukraine-Belarus border, Nayev said. Last year, Ukraine started constructing a wall along its border with Belarus, which includes a ditch, a reinforced concrete fence and barbed wire, among other barriers. Ukraine and Belarus share a border of about 1,000 km.  â–
