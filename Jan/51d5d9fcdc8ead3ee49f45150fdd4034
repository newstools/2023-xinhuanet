ABUJA, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were killed after a truck conveying over 70 people overturned in the country's central Plateau State, Nigeria's traffic police confirmed on Sunday. Peter Longsan, a spokesman for the Federal Road Safety Corps in Plateau, told reporters in the state capital of Jos, that scores of people were also injured as the truck overturned due to loss of control on a road near the Jwak village located in the Mangu local government area late Saturday. A comprehensive report of the accident had not been fully compiled by the traffic police, Longsan said. Deadly road accidents are frequently reported in Nigeria, often caused by overloading, bad road conditions, and reckless driving.  â–
