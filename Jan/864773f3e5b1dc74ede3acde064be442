ISTANBUL, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Insufficient rainfall has caused severe drought throughout Türkiye, especially in the highly populated western and northwestern regions, according to data released Thursday.

With a 51.8 percent drop in rainfall compared to seasonal norms, Istanbul, a city of over 16 million residents, was hit the worst among Türkiye's major urban centers. The Istanbul municipality reported Friday that the Alibeykoy Dam Reservoir, one of Istanbul's primary water sources, was severely affected, reaching only 18.29 percent of its capacity. Ankara, the capital and second largest city, saw a 36.4 percent decline in precipitation, and the Aegean port city of Izmir saw a 41.7 percent decline, data from the meteorological service showed.

In a recent video statement, the Turkish Agricultural Chambers Union officials said that in 60 cities out of all 81, precipitation was insufficient to meet agricultural needs.  ■
