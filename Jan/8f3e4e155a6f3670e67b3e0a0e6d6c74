SHEBIRGHAN, Afghanistan, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Three commuters including two school students were killed and four others wounded in two separate road accidents in the northern Faryab and Baghlan provinces on Friday, officials said Saturday. Two high school students lost their lives and another sustained injury after two corolla cars collided head-on with each other in Andkhoy district of Faryab province late Friday, a local official said. In another road accident on Friday afternoon, one commuter was killed and three others wounded in Dushi district of northern Baghlan province, provincial police spokesman Mawlawi Shir Ahmad Burhani confirmed. Afghan traffic officials often blame reckless driving for deadly road incidents in Afghanistan. Over two dozen travelers have been confirmed dead and injured due to road crashes on congested roads in war-ravaged Afghanistan over the past several weeks.  â–
