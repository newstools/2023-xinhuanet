JUBA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SSPDF) said it has dislodged the White Army militia in Upper Nile State and Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA). SSPDF spokesperson Lul Ruai Koang told journalists in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, that calm has since returned to Upper Nile and GPAA after they pushed out the White Army, predominantly made up of Lou-Nuer fighters from Jonglei State. "Regarding Upper Nile in Chollo Kingdom, we were able to deploy the regular unit from SSPDF and it successfully confronted the White Army that crossed from Jonglei to Chollo Kingdom," Koang said Tuesday evening. He added that he was able to see humanitarian organizations distributing non-food items to displaced people. Koang said the SSPDF have also driven out Lou-Nuer fighters in Greater Pibor. In November 2022, the White Army attacked Fashoda County of Upper Nile State, displacing more than 30,000 civilians. President Salva Kiir ordered for the safe evacuation to Juba of the Chollo King on Dec. 1 last year following threats on the latter's life. On Dec. 24, thousands of members of the White Army stormed Lanam village, Gumuruk town and Lekuangole in GPAA in a revenge attack that left more than 57 people dead and over 40,000 civilians displaced. Some political observers of South Sudan have warned that rampant communal violence threatens to scuttle a fragile revitalized peace agreement signed under international pressure.  â–
