WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday morning it was "working to fully restore the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) system following an outage." The FAA has ordered airlines to pause all domestic departures until 9:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) to allow the agency to validate the integrity of flight and safety information, according to a statement. Airlines for America, the association representing U.S. airlines, said that the outage is "causing significant operational delays." United Airlines said it has temporarily delayed all domestic flights. A NOTAM is a notice containing information essential to personnel concerned with flight operations but not known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means, the FAA said.  â–
