The sectoral council meeting is also expected to give directions on the convening of the 5th EAC Heads of State Retreat on Infrastructure Development and Financing, the premier event that brings together political and policy decision-makers, technocrats, development partners, and the private sector to discuss ways of unlocking the estimated 50-billion-U.S.-dollar annual funding gap for the region's infrastructure development, said the statement. According to the statement, the five-day meeting on Feb. 6-10 brings together stakeholders from government ministries in the EAC member states, agencies, regional organizations, and the private sector to discuss challenges in the development of infrastructure and make recommendations on how to address them. The sector and sub-sectors involved in transport communications and meteorology are roads, railways, maritime transport, telecommunications, ICT, postal services, civil aviation, airports and meteorology, said the statement.
