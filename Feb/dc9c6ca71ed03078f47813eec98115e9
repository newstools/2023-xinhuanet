DAR ES SALAAM, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Mara regional authorities said on Saturday plans are underway to construct a 33 kilometers fence to control wild animals from raiding five villages in the Serengeti district in the region. Suleiman Mzee, the Mara regional commissioner, said the fence will protect the villages from frequent raids by wild animals, chiefly elephants, from the Serengeti National Park, world-renowned for its abundance of animals and the great wildebeest migration, and other game reserves. The construction of the fence will be done by a private conservation organization in collaboration with the regional authorities, Mzee said. He said the construction of the fence follows the success shown by the construction of a 30 kilometers fence that protected some villages. "Since the fence was constructed in 2018, raids by wild animals have been controlled."  â–
