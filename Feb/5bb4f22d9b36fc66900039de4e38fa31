TOKYO, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on Thursday stepped away from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's pledge to double the budget for child-rearing from the current 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to tackle the falling birthrate. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told the press that by talking about increasing spending on the childcare budget as a percentage of GDP, the government was not setting any specific "criteria" in the future to achieve the goal. The revision came a day after Kishida said during a parliamentary session that Japan's public expenditures for child-rearing support reached 2 percent of GDP in the fiscal year ending March 2021, and that the government is aiming to "double the amount." The remarks fueled speculation and raised fears among the public that the Japanese government would raise taxes to cover the budget rise. The prime minister cited the figure as an example of how the government was looking to increase the budget, Matsuno said.  â–
