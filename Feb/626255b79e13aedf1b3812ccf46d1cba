BUCHAREST, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita announced her resignation on Friday, according to Moldpres, the national news agency. A few hours later, the country's President, Maia Sandu, appointed 48-year-old Dorin Recean, Gavrilita's defense and national security advisor since Feb. 2022, as her successor. "The time has come (for me) to announce my resignation," Gavrilita told journalists. The new government would have to enhance the country's security level and speed up the reforms in the judicial system, Sandu told a briefing at the Presidential Palace. "The new cabinet needs to concentrate its attention on economic development and reinvigoration. We need to stimulate economic growth and attract high-quality foreign investment," she added. Accepting his nomination, Recean said that "We will immediately launch actions on three important dimensions: order and discipline in institutions, a new life for the economy and peace and stability." Under the Constitution, the prime minister-designate has 15 days to form his cabinet and to ask for Parliament's vote of confidence. Gavrilita, who took over as prime minister on Aug. 6, 2021, did not specify the reasons for her resignation, but complained that while her cabinet enjoyed external support, at home there was no sufficient backing for her reforms.  â–
