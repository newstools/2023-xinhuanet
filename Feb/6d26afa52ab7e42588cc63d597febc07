PARIS, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- A mother and her seven children aged between 2 and 14 died in a house fire early on Monday in France's northern department of Aisne, the local prefecture confirmed in a press release. Just after midnight, the blaze ripped through a two-story house in the city of Charly-sur-Marne. A firefighter could rescue a severely burnt man, who was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, the prefecture said, adding that his condition was not life-threatening. However, the rescue teams found 8 dead bodies -- that of a woman in her 40s and her seven children. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. In 2013, five children aged between 2 and 9 were killed in a fire in Saint-Quentin, also in the department of Aisne, local media reported.  â–
