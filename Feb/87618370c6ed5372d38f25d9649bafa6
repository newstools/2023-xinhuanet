JAKARTA, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita inaugurated on Tuesday the first exports of the country's locally-made hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in Karawang Regency, West Java province. These HEVs, which have 70 percent of components made in Indonesia, will be shipped to 19 nations across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. There will be 8,800 units of HEVs for export throughout 2023, Kartasasmita said at the inauguration ceremony at PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia (TMMIN)'s factory. "This step is in line with the Indonesian government's target of increasing the use of renewable resources for upstream-to-downstream industries," he said.  â–
