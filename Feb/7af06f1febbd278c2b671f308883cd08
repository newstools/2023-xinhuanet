ACCRA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghana recorded an inflation rate of 53.6 percent in January, the first drop from the previous month since May 2021. The January inflation rate was 0.5 percentage points lower than the 54.1 percent recorded a month earlier, according to the Ghana Statistical Service. "We saw a decline in non-food inflation to 47.9 percent in January compared with 49.9 percent in December. The 2.0 percentage point dip in non-food inflation led to the drop in the overall inflation rate," Samuel Kobina Annim, a government statistician, said at a regular press briefing. He said that food inflation stood at 61 percent in January, an increase from the December figure of 59.7 percent. Meanwhile, inflation for locally produced and imported items stood at 50 percent and 62.5 percent, respectively. Ghana experienced volatility in its inflation computation last year, with the rate surging from 13.9 percent in January 2022 to 54.1 percent at year-end in December.  â–
