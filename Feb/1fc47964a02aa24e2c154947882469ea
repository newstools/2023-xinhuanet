DHAKA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's largest annual book fair kicked off in the capital Dhaka on Wednesday. The Amar Ekushey Boi Mela, which literally means "Immortal Twenty First Book Fair," is being held in Dhaka's Bangla Academy premises and its adjacent Suhrawardy Udyan (garden). Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the month-long book fair. Bangla Academy Director General Poet Nurul Huda said police have tightened security in and around the Bangla Academy premises to ensure security of book lovers and publishers at the fair. He said a total of 901 stalls have been allocated to 601 organizations this year. Many new books are published every year during the mega book fair of the South Asian country. Like the previous years, there will be a two-day International Literature Conference on the sidelines of the fair with a view to paving the way for a good bonding among the local and foreign writers.  â–
