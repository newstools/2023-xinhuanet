FRANKFURT, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosch boosted its sales by over 10 percent in 2022, and is looking ahead to a rebound of business in China, the company said on Friday. Bosch's preliminary financial results for the year 2022 show that the company's total sales came to 88.4 billion euros (95.4 billion U.S. dollars), up by 12 percent year on year. Taking the exchange rate into account, sales grew by 10 percent. Bosch's business falls into different fields including mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and energy and building technology. Mobility solutions posted the strongest growth of 17 percent in 2022.
