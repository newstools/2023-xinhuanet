LAGOS, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Five policemen were killed as security operatives responded to an attempted attack on civilians in Nigeria's northern Niger state, authorities said. Wasiu Abiodun, a police spokesperson in Niger, said a combined team of police and military on Saturday responded to a call about a group of gunmen seen near a village in the state's Gurara local government area, attempting to "attack some communities." Some of the gunmen were killed while others escaped with bullet injuries, he said late Sunday, adding that the five policemen lost their lives during the fighting. Another reinforcement team was sent to the scene to beef up security around the area, Abiodun said.  â–
