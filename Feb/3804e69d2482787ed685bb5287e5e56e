JAKARTA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia on Thursday celebrated 100 days to go until the opening of FIFA Under-20 World Cup. The southeast Asian country was originally due to host the tournament in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced FIFA to postpone the event. The FIFA U20 World Cup is scheduled to take place in May and June this year. "Preparing to host the U20 World Cup in Indonesia is the work of all Indonesian people. I'm appealing to all parties, please support all preparations for the national team for the World Cup," said Zainudin Amali, Indonesia's Minister of Sport and Youth. "We will take care of it together, not only for the national team but also for the preparations for the host. This is a national interest that must be put forward," Amali added.  â–
