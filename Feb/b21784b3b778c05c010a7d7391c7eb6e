ACCRA, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ghanaian official on Thursday praised the 11th batch of Chinese medical team in Ghana which is about to wrap up its mission in March for their efforts to safeguard Ghanaian people's lives. Speaking to Xinhua in an interview held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, Anastasia Michaelina, director for the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Directorate of the Health Ministry, said the Chinese doctors have gone to great lengths to save people's lives and impart knowledge to their Ghanaian counterparts. "The team consists of top-notch doctors from China's Guangdong Province, and their expertise and intelligence have contributed a lot to Ghana's healthcare sector, and they have done a good job," she said. The director also said the team has successfully introduced laparoscopic surgery into the LEKMA Hospital where the team is based, which has helped many patients speed up their recovery. The team has also rolled out free surgeries for impoverished Ghanaians suffering from cataracts under a charity project, which has helped more than ten locals regain their vision since last year, she said. "Ghana is grateful for what they have done," the official emphasized. "All the specialists have not only augmented the workforce in the hospital but also made a donation of much-needed equipment to us, their kind gesture should be applauded." The official told Xinhua that she is looking forward to welcoming more Chinese doctors into Ghana and she is confident they will have a larger role to play in boosting the country's health sector. According to the Chinese medical team, in the year 2022 alone, they received more than 13,000 local patients and carried out over 800 surgeries.  â–
