ISLAMABAD, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani security forces have killed a hardcore terrorist in an operation in the country's southwest Balochistan province, said a military statement. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistani army, said on Friday in the statement that the security forces conducted the operation after receiving credible information about the presence of a wanted terrorist in the Awaran district of the province. The ISPR said that a heliborne force was used to sanitize the area, adding that one terrorist was killed in an exchange of fire during the ensuing operation, and a large cache of weapons and ammunition was seized. The terrorist had been involved in the attacks on the security forces with improvised explosive devices in the region, said the military, vowing that the security forces would continue to thwart any attempt by inimical elements to disrupt hard-earned peace in the province. Pakistan's security forces had conducted 3,414 operations in Balochistan during the last three months, and killed 40 terrorists, and arrested 112 others, according to an official report released earlier this week.  â–
