SEOUL, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's employment growth continued to slow for the eighth consecutive month last month amid rising economic uncertainties such as interest rate hikes, statistical office data showed Wednesday. The number of those employed was 27,363,000 in January, up 411,000 from the same month of last year, according to Statistics Korea. It was the lowest increase in 22 months since March 2021. Jobs have kept growing for 23 months, but the year-over-year employment growth has been on the decline for the eighth successive month, sliding from 935,000 in May last year to 826,000 in July, 707,000 in September, 626,000 in November and 509,000 in December each. Uncertainties escalated over the Asian economy amid rapid interest rate hikes that fueled worry about an economic downturn. The country's central bank began to tighten its monetary policy stance in August 2021, hiking its benchmark interest rate from a record low of 0.50 percent to 3.50 percent. External uncertainty also mounted. Export, which accounts for about half of the export-driven economy, kept falling for the fourth consecutive month through January. The number of jobs among manufacturers reduced 35,000 in January from a year earlier, marking the first fall in 15 months since October 2021 on the back of the export slump. Employment in the lodging and eatery and the health and social welfare services sectors grew 214,000 and 220,000 each in the cited month. The reading in the finance and insurance sector added 16,000 in January, rebounding in 13 months since December 2021. The number of jobs lost in the construction, the wholesale and retail, and the transport and warehousing segments stood at 39,000, 61,000 and 51,000 respectively. The overall job increase was led by the elderly people. The number of jobs among those aged 60 or higher surged 400,000 last month, while those in their 50s and 30s climbed 107,000 and 17,000 each. The number of regular employees expanded 575,000, but the figures for irregular workers and daily laborers shrank 52,000 and 70,000, respectively. The number of the self-employed who hired workers increased 54,000, but the figure for the self-employed without employees dwindled 25,000 in January, turning downward for the first time in 48 months. Employment rate for those aged 15 or higher added 0.7 percentage points over the year to 60.3 percent in January, while the OECD-method hiring rate for those aged 15-64 went up 0.8 percentage points to 67.8 percent. The number of those unemployed was 1,024,000 in January, down 119,000 from a year earlier. Jobless rate declined 0.5 percentage points to 3.6 percent. The expanded jobless rate retreated 2.6 percentage points to 10.5 percent last month, and the rate for those aged 15-29 slumped 2.8 percentage points to 16.9 percent. The official unemployment rate gauges those who are immediately available for work but failed to get a job for the past four weeks despite efforts to seek a job actively. The expanded jobless rate, called labor underutilization indicator, adds those who are discouraged from searching a job, those who work part-time against their will to work full-time, and those who prepare to get a job after college graduation, to the official unemployment rate. The economically inactive population, who had no willingness to seek a job and remained unemployed, went down 139,000 over the year to 16,965,000 in January. The reading for discouraged job seekers diminished 140,000 to 388,000 last month. The number of the "take-a-rest" group, who replied that they took a rest during a job survey period, slipped 84,000 to 2,653,000. The take-a-rest group is considered important as it can include those who are too discouraged to seek a job for an extended period.  â–
