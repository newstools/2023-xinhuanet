KABUL, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan caretaker government has appointed charge d'affaires and diplomats to Afghanistan's embassy in Iran's capital Tehran, Afghan foreign affairs spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on Monday. According to local media, Fazl Mohammad Haqqani, first secretary of the former ambassador of Afghanistan in Iran, has been appointed as charge d'affaires in Tehran, whose name has not been mentioned in the official statement of Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan informs all Afghans residing in the Islamic Republic of Iran that the Afghan embassy activities will continue in Tehran following the dispatching of newly appointed charge d'affaires and diplomats with a firm commitment and spirit to serving the citizens of the two countries," Balkhi said on his Twitter account. Describing reshuffling diplomats as usual of administrative affairs, Balkhi said that "we believe that with the new appointments, we would witness transparency in the affairs of the embassy as well as expanded relations in various fields between the two Muslim and brotherly countries." Since the Taliban took over the power of the country in August 2021, Iran like a few other countries has kept its embassy open and called upon the international community to remain engaged with the new Afghan establishment.  â–
