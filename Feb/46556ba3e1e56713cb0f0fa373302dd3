ANKARA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven people who survived the powerful earthquakes on Feb. 6 were killed on Friday in a fire that hit the house in Türkiye's central city of Konya where they were seeking shelter, local media reported The seven victims were all from a Syrian family that had eight members and came to stay with their relatives in Konya from southern Gaziantep Province after last week's massive earthquakes, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported. The parents and five children of the Syrian family were killed, it said, adding the children were aged between four and 13. The Anadolu Agency also cited an eyewitness as saying the fire was possibly caused by the electric heater or stove during the night. Millions of Syrian refugees are currently living in Türkiye after a civil war broke up in the Arab country in 2011. Most of the Syrians in Türkiye live in poverty and the earthquakes have put more strains on their already-suffering life. More than 38,000 people lost their lives in southern Türkiye as a result of the twin 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude quakes on Feb. 6, making it the deadliest such disaster of the country in the past century.  ■
