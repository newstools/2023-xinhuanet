NEW YORK, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks climbed on Monday, recouping some of the losses they had suffered in the prior week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72.17 points, or 0.22 percent, to 32,889.09. The S&P 500 added 12.20 points, or 0.31 percent, to 3,982.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 72.04 points, or 0.63 percent, to 11,466.98. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with consumer discretionary and industrials up 1.18 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively, outpacing the rest. Utilities fell 0.77 percent, the worst-performing group. Last week, the Dow fell 3 percent, the S&P 500 decreased 2.7 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.3 percent, amid concerns over inflation and higher interest rates. "The stickiness in U.S. inflation in January and a still-tight labor market suggest that the Federal Reserve will need to increase rates further, perhaps substantially, in order to bring inflation back to target," UBS analysts said in a note on Monday. "Caught between these divergent potential outcomes, equity markets have been left trading well above October's lows while also lacking the conviction to move materially higher," they added.  â–
