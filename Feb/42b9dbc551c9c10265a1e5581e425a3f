Lukashenko arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday for his first visit to Sub-Saharan Africa at the invitation of Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The two leaders presided on Tuesday over the signing of eight Memorandums of Understanding regarding cooperation on agricultural machinery supply and others to further deepen bilateral relations. Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe seeks to benefit from Belarus' developed agricultural and manufacturing sectors. "We have already begun benefiting from the mechanization from Belarus. We now wish to further this cooperation to extend to other aspects of the economy like our mining sector, and our tourism," he said. Lukashenko said Belarus is keen to work with Zimbabwe for the benefit of the local people. Belarus has provided Zimbabwe with agricultural equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters following Mnangagwa's visit in 2019. The mechanization of Zimbabwe's agricultural sector has brought the country a record wheat harvest, making Zimbabwe wheat sufficient after decades of imports. â–
