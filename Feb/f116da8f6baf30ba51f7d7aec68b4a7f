HOUSTON, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday reported an increase of 6.33 million barrels of crude oil in U.S. inventories for the week ending Jan. 27. Analysts had expected a drop of 1 million barrels for this week. The API reported a surge of 3.378 million barrels in the previous week. Oil prices ended mixed on Tuesday as traders awaited a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve and latest data on U.S. fuel stockpiles. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery rose 97 cents, or 1.25 percent, to settle at 78.87 U.S. dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude for March delivery lost 41 cents, or 0.48 percent, to close at 84.49 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange. "Headwind is being generated by generally negative market sentiment ahead of this week's numerous central bank meetings and by the persistently high Russian oil exports," Carsten Fritsch, energy analyst at Commerzbank Research, said in a note Tuesday. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points when concluding a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday.  â–
