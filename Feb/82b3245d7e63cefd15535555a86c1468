PHNOM PENH, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia on Friday decided to lower the fee for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test with a certificate to 50 U.S. dollars from the current 130 dollars for outbound travelers, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said. For all the authorized COVID-19-testing laboratories in the country, the new price for a PCR test with a result certificate, for outbound Cambodians and foreigners who may need it, is set at 50 U.S. dollars, Mam said in a statement. "The new price will take effect from Feb. 18, 2023 onwards," he added. The minister said the PCR test will be made at the request of outbound travelers only, as the Southeast Asian nation does not require any travelers to undergo either a rapid antigen test or a PCR test. A Ministry of Health's latest report showed that to date, Cambodia has inoculated 14.63 million people, 91.4 percent of its 16 million population, with two required COVID-19 vaccine doses.  â–
