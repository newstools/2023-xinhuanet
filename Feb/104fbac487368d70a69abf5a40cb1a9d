JUBA, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and its partners launched an appeal Tuesday, seeking 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to protect and assist 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees in the eastern Africa region. The UNHCR said the funds will be used to support South Sudanese refugees and their local host communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda. "The appeal also aims to provide digital cash assistance, and other resilience-enhancing initiatives such as access to finance and training, to help refugees and local communities generate income, supplement their needs and live in dignity," it said in a statement. The latest appeal comes amid a deteriorating economic outlook across the region as the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the ripple effects of the conflict in Ukraine have pushed up fuel and food prices and increased unemployment. According to the UNHCR, host countries that have generously welcomed South Sudanese refugees are bearing the strain of the crisis amid staggering levels of underfunding, prolonged drought, and severe food shortages, including food ration cuts for refugees. The UN which launched the South Sudan Refugee Response Plan called on the international community to scale up support for the millions of refugees who are unable to return home. It said South Sudan continues to face a fragile peace and security environment marked by cycles of sporadic violence, and the impacts of an unfolding climate crisis. Four years of unrelenting floods have inundated two-thirds of the country, damaging tens of thousands of people's houses, farmland, and livestock, the UNHCR said. "This support will be crucial in meeting refugees' most immediate needs in host countries, including for shelter, education, health, and food assistance," the UN Refugee Agency said.  â–
