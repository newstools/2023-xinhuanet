HAVANA, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters in Cuba are battling to put out a second large-scale wildfire in the country's eastern province of Holguin, local media reported Monday. The fire, the second hitting Holguin in a couple of weeks, has caused disruptions across the mountainous region of Pinares de Mayari, and threatens to spread to the rural towns of Vivero 2, Pueblo Nuevo and La Mensura, the Cuban News Agency reported. No casualties or injuries have been reported so far. Earlier this year, a wildfire burnt some 1,000 hectares in the mountainous area of El Prado, in the eastern municipality of Mayari. According to Cuban authorities, the provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, Holguin and Camaguey, and the Isle of Youth were the hardest hit by fires last month. The Caribbean nation faces a prolonged drought affecting 62 percent of the country, the Cuban Meteorology Institute said.  â–
