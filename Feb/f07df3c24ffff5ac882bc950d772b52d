COLOMBO, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has increased Sri Lanka's annual job quota to 6,500 in 2023, a Sri Lankan minister said Monday. Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said this is the highest quota Sri Lanka has received since the job program with South Korea started. The minister said that over 300,000 Sri Lankans left for foreign jobs in 2022 and Sri Lankans need more foreign job opportunities. Workers' remittance is one of the main sources of foreign revenues for Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan workers remitted around 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, official data revealed.  â–
