LJUBLJANA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's exports and imports of goods in value increased by more than 30 percent in 2022, the country's Statistical Office said on Friday, with figures indicating a strong economic performance of the export-oriented European Union (EU) member state. "Slovenia's exports in 2022 amounted to 52.9 billion euros and imports to 56.8 billion euros. The value of external trade was much higher than in the previous year, exports were up by 34.2 percent and imports by 36.6 percent," the office said in a press release. China was Slovenia's fourth largest import partner with imports from China representing 8.9 percent of the country's total imports last year, the office said. Figures showed that chemicals and related products represented more than a third of the country's imports and exports. Other main export items included cars, car parts and household appliances. Local household appliances producer Gorenje, which is owned by China's Hisense, is one of Slovenia's largest exporters. Slovenia's main export partners include Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Croatia, Austria and France. In spite of the global energy crisis, analysts expect Slovenia's economy to continue to grow this year. The government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by about 1.4 percent this year versus 5 percent in 2022.  â–
