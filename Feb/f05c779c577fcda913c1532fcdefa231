KIEV, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday arrived in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, one day after thousands rallied in Washington to protest U.S. war-mongering foreign policy and its role in various conflicts across the globe. Media reports said Biden will announce a 500-million U.S. dollar military aid to Ukraine, a move that is widely believed to further escalate regional conflict. Domestically, Biden is currently faced with mounting pressures due to thorny issues, including a hazmat train derailment. â–
