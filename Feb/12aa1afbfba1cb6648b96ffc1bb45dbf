According to a statement signed by Acting President U Myint Swe, the emergency period is extended in accordance with the Section 425 of the State Constitution for six months from Feb. 1, 2023, citing that as unusual circumstances are happening in the country, only if the emergency period is extended, will the Commander-in-Chief accomplish his responsibilities.

At the meeting, the acting president declared the extension of the state of emergency, and handed over the state power again to Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing under Section 419 of the constitution, it said.
