TUNIS, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Kais Saied and his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Tuesday held a phone conversation over bilateral ties, said the Tunisian presidency. During the conversation, the two leaders highlighted "the solidity of relations between Tunisia and Algeria," it said in a statement. "This telephone call was a renewed opportunity to underline the solidity of the relations between the two countries and the two brotherly peoples in all areas," it added. The phone talk came a few days after Algerian activist Amira Bouraoui entered Tunisia illegally about a week ago, before transiting to France. This incident sparked a diplomatic crisis as Algeria accuses French diplomats and intelligence agents of having smuggled Bouraoui to France via Tunisia.  â–
