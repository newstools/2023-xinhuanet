ATHENS, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- The opening ceremony of "2023 Eleusis European Capital of Culture" was held on Saturday in Elefsina, some 20 km west of Athens. Inspired by ancient Greek mythology it included processions of people arriving from land and sea, music and dance throughout the streets and the seafront and exhibitions hosted in old factories transformed in art galleries. "Today Elefsina is shaping its modern identity by combining its archaeological and industrial history with the new infrastructure it is acquiring thanks to its declaration as the cultural capital of Europe for 2023," Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said addressing the ceremony, according to Greek national broadcaster ERT. Elefsina is one of the three European cities holding the title this year and the fourth Greek city since 1985, when Athens was the first title-holder.
