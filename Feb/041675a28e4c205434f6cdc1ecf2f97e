WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The American people, numbed to the deaths and serious injuries from gun violence, have developed almost a "choreographed" response to the deadly reality, an opinion piece published on the website of FunTimes Magazine has said. From the time a gun tragedy is reported, "the media descend on the location, a phalanx of police officials share the pertinent details of the tragedy, somber-faced politicians express that their thoughts and prayers are with the victims' families, and for about a week there are panels of crime experts on TV calling for increased gun legislation and the psychology of gun violence," the article said on Tuesday. More Americans died of gun-related injuries in 2020 than in any other year on record, the article cited data from the Pew Research Center. "Compared to 22 other 'high-income' nations, the U.S. gun related homicide rate is 25 times higher." In essence, nothing changes as the death toll from gun violence in the nation continues to climb and gun sales spike, the article said.  â–
