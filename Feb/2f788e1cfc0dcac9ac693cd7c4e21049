ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned of the impacts of the drought in the Horn of Africa region. "Following a historic fifth consecutive failed rainy season in the Horn of Africa, more than 36 million people have been affected by the drought in the region, of which more than 2 million people have been forced to leave their homes in search of life-saving assistance," the IOM said in its latest East and Horn of Africa Drought Response Situation Report issued late Monday. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) last week warned that catastrophic consequences of the multi-year drought will continue in 2023 in the Horn of Africa region, leaving communities in urgent need of assistance. According to a new seasonal forecast, below-normal rainfall is expected in most parts of the region over the next three months, the WMO said in a statement issued last Wednesday. "Should this happen, it would be an unprecedented sixth poor season for the worst hit countries -- Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia." The WMO said the current drought began with the poor performance of the October-December 2020 rains and has since deepened with all four subsequent seasons also performing poorly. A persistent La Nina event has had a key influence.  â–
