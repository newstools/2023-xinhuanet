CAIRO, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi made a phone call to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday, extending his condolences to the victims of the recent deadly earthquakes that hit Türkiye. "He reiterated Egypt's solidarity with the brotherly Turkish people, offering assistance and humanitarian aid to overcome the effects of this disaster," Egyptian presidential spokesman Ahmed Fahmy said in a statement. Erdogan expressed appreciation for Egypt's support and solidarity, noting that they demonstrate "the profound historical bonds" the Egyptian and Turkish peoples share, Fahmy said. Earlier in the day, Sisi made a similar phone call to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over the strong earthquake that jolted the country simultaneously like the one in Türkiye. Assad appreciated Sisi's kind gesture, stressing "the historical and fraternal relations" between the two countries, Fahmy said. Also on Tuesday, Egypt sent five military planes loaded with medical supplies to both Syria and Türkiye to help with the treatment of those injured in the devastating earthquakes, Egypt's official MENA news agency reported. More than 5,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of others injured by the massive earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The quakes were also felt in Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel and other surrounding countries.  ■
