HANOI, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Southern Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong province led the country in foreign direct investment (FDI) attraction in 2022. The two localities attracted 3.94 billion U.S. dollars and 3.14 billion U.S. dollars, respectively, local newspaper Vietnam News reported on Thursday. Ho Chi Minh City, which topped the country in the total value of foreign investments in 2022, has several advantages in economic development, particularly high-quality human resources, and relatively developed infrastructure to attract investment in high-tech service industries, according to economic experts. Vietnam's southeast region, which comprises one municipality, Ho Chi Minh City, and five provinces, will continue to be the major FDI magnet of the country in 2023. In recent years, localities in this region have made better preparation to welcome foreign investors, including improved transport infrastructure, local newspaper Bao Dau Tu (Investment) reported. A number of major transport projects including Ring Road Number 3 which connects Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong, Dong Nai, and Long An will be constructed this year. Localities including Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong, Dong Nai, and Ba Ria-Vung Tau also accelerated the expansion and building of industrial parks to welcome investors.  â–
