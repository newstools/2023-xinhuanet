PUL-E-KHUMRI, Afghanistan, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Police have discovered a weapon cache containing a variety of arms and ammunition in Afghanistan's northern Baghlan province, provincial police spokesman Mawlawi Shir Ahmad Burhani said Sunday. Acting on a tip-off, the policemen stormed a house in the provincial capital Pul-e-Khumri city late Saturday and found a huge quantity of arms and ammunition including one piece of Rocket Propelled Grenade, five AK-47, 13 pistols and 13 hand grenades, the official added. Security forces have already collected thousands of pieces of arms and ammunition during search operations from Baghlan and the neighboring Kunduz and Samangan provinces over the past few months. The Afghan caretaker government has vowed to collect arms and ammunition from anyone outside security organs as part of the efforts to stabilize peace and security in war-ravaged Afghanistan.  â–
