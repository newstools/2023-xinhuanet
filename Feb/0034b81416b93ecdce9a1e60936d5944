NEW DELHI, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- India's private airline company Air India (AI) will soon purchase 250 new aircraft from Airbus. The deal includes 40 A350 wide-body long-range aircraft and 210 narrow-body. The airline company last month committed 400 million U.S. dollars to refurbish the interiors of its entire wide-body fleet. Air India said these will incorporate the "latest generation seats and best-in-class inflight entertainment systems", said a report by the NDTV. According to the report, the deal with Airbus was part of an order by Air India for 470 planes, which is also likely to include an order for 220 planes from Boeing.  â–
