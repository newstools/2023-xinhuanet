NEW DELHI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government decided on Friday to further reduce the reserve price of wheat from March 31 to check the inflationary trend in food economy. According to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, states may be allowed to purchase wheat from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for their own scheme at above proposed reserve prices without participating in e-auction. "Reduction in reserve price will help in reducing market price of wheat and wheat products for consumers," the ministry said in a statement. Last week, the Indian government offloaded 3 million tons of wheat under the Open Market Disposal Scheme to cool down prices of wheat and wheat flour.  â–
