TOKYO, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on Monday revised up its composite index of coincident economic indicators for December last year. According to the Cabinet Office, the revised coincident index, which reflects current economic conditions, came in as 99.1 against 100 for the base year of 2015, up from 98.9 in the preliminary report released earlier this month. The index was down 0.2 point from the previous month, compared with the preliminary reading of a 0.4-point fall. A rise in the coincident index indicates an expansion of economic activity and a decline alludes to a contraction. The December leading index, a yardstick for the economy's performance months ahead, fell 0.5 point to 97.2, unchanged from the preliminary report.  â–
