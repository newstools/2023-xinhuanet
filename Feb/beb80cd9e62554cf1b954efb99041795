COPENHAGEN, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2022, primarily driven by strong industrial performance, Statistics Denmark said on Tuesday. Based on Q4 figures, Statistics Denmark's preliminary estimate is that in 2022 year-on-year GDP growth was 3.4 percent. "The significant increase in GDP is primarily attributable to industry, more specifically the pharmaceutical industry," it said. The country's transport, culture and leisure industries also contributed positively to GDP growth in Q4 2022. However, "several industries experienced decline or stagnation, including trade, business services, and finance and insurance." According to Sydbank's chief economist Soren Kristensen quoted by the Danish news agency Ritzau, GDP growth was attributable to the performance of a few large companies rather than to "broad-based strong growth." â–
