ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition kicked off Thursday at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the creation of civil aviation in Russia. The exhibition, designed to introduce the history of Russian aviation, is being held in the Terminal 2 of the airport. It will be open to visitors for 12 months. According to the press service of Pulkovo, the exhibition covers an area of more than 2,000 square meters and is divided into four thematic blocks: historical, technical, biographical and ideological. More than 180 exhibits, including aircraft parts, pilot suits, technical models and multimedia biographies of aviation heroes, represent all stages of the development of Russian aviation. Visitors can try themselves in various thematic interactive activities. On Feb. 9, 1923, the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) adopted a resolution of the Council of Labor and Defense "On the assignment of technical supervision of air lines to the Main Directorate of the Air Fleet and on the organization of the Council for Civil Aviation." This date has thereafter been deemed the birthday of Russian civil aviation.  â–
