TRIPOLI, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- A cruise line between Libya and Tunisia was launched on Sunday for the first time in over 11 years. The launch ceremony of the cruise line was attended by the Minister of Transport Mohamed al-Shuhubi, the Tunisian Ambassador to Libya al-As'ad al-Ajli, and a number of senior Libyan officials, the Libyan Ministry of Transport said in a statement. Efforts will be made in the future to launch several cruise lines from Libya to several neighboring countries, the statement added.
