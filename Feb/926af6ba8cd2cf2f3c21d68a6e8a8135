COLOMBO, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka on Thursday decided to suspend daily power cuts as a 66 percent increase of electricity tariffs came into effect. Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said that the new tariffs came into effect as it has been approved by the regulator. The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) approved the revision despite its Chairman Janaka Ratnayake raising objections. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe directed the authorities to provide concessions for low-income families and solar rooftop systems for religious places and government educational institutions. "President Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a directive to the minister of power and energy and the relevant officials to implement the tariff revision, ensuring the uninterrupted power supply for the electricity customers," the President's Media Division said on Thursday. Sri Lanka raised electricity tariffs by 75 percent in August 2022. However, the state-owned electricity producer, Ceylon Electricity Board, said it continued to make losses and in January 2023, the cabinet of ministers authorized another tariff hike.  â–
