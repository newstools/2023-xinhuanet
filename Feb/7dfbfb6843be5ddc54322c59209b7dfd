HANOI, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's automotive companies have called for government support to make the country's car supply chain more self-sufficient, the Vietnam News reported Friday. Vietnam's automotive component industry has lagged behind other Southeast Asian countries, let alone on international levels, as currently only 7-10 percent of components and parts used in 9-seat passenger cars manufactured in the country are locally made, compared to the 60-80 percent level in Thailand, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. "As many as 20,000 individual parts go into the production of a vehicle, of which 200 parts are made of metal materials, and auto parts companies in Vietnam can not supply a single of these parts," Phan Dang Tuat, chairman of the Vietnam Association for Supporting Industries, said at a conference in the lead-up to the 2023 Automechanika trade fair for the automotive service industry. According to statistics released by the ministry, the country has about 100 tier-1 manufacturers which directly supply to major carmakers, compared to 700 tier-1 companies in Thailand. The number of tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers in Vietnam is around 150, much lower than 1,700 in Thailand. Industry executives said that they urgently need the government to issue strategic support measures. In 2020, the government set a target that by 2030 supporting industries will be able to meet 70 percent of domestic production demand, and account for about 14 percent of industrial production value. Some 2,000 companies are expected to be capable of supplying directly to assemblers and multinational manufacturers by 2030 in such sectors as electronics, mechanical engineering, hi-tech and automobile industry. Demand for cars in Vietnam has consistently grown since 2007 at an average rate of 16.3 percent, according to a data provider. Experts explained that the Vietnamese people's rising average income significantly contributes to high demand for car ownership. Auto retailers in Vietnam posted record profits last year with sales up 33 percent to hit 404,635 units as demand recovered after a two-year slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  â–
