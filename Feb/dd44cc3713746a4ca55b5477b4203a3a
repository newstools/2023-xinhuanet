ANKARA, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye's disaster management agency updated Wednesday the death toll from the earthquake to 7,108, with around 40,000 injured. Fatalities are likely to rise as the damage spread over a wide area of 10 provinces, flattening nearly 6,000 buildings. Rescue teams are racing against time, digging trapped survivors out of the rubble amid freezing temperatures. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared Tuesday a three-month state of emergency in 10 of the country's quake-stricken provinces. A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras. The Chinese embassy in Türkiye confirmed that no Chinese casualties had been reported yet.  ■
