FRANKFURT, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- As expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday increased interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) and sent out a dovish message about the outlook for future rate hikes. "In view of the underlying inflation pressures, the Governing Council intends to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at its next monetary policy meeting in March and it will then evaluate the subsequent path of its monetary policy," the bank said in a statement.  â–
