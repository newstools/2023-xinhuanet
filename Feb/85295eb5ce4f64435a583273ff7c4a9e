RABAT, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Moroccan navy rescued 167 Spain-bound migrants in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic from Jan. 28 to Feb. 7, official news agency MAP reported Wednesday. The migrants have attempted dangerous crossings and encountered problems while boarding several makeshift boats, kayaks, jet skis, and even swimming, MAP said. Before being taken to the closest Moroccan ports and handed over to the Royal Gendarmerie for the usual procedures, the migrants received first aid from navy units, according to the report. Morocco has become a transit country for African migrants seeking to reach Europe for better living conditions, as the shortest distance from Morocco's Mediterranean coasts to Spain is only 14 km via the Strait of Gibraltar.  â–
